This mini-project demonstrates a clean and minimal MVI architecture in Android, focusing on unidirectional data flow and clear UI–ViewModel communication. 
It provides a simple, easy-to-follow example suitable for learning or onboarding. 
The codebase accompanies an article on Medium and illustrates how to structure state management, actions, and effects in a modern Android app. 
Perfect as a starting point for experimenting with MVI patterns.
